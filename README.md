Creating a DSL to play Mozart

## Playback via speakers
Using a Xonar DX, there was a pop at the beginning of play.
Turning off SVN fixed that.
But there's stil an anoying click between notes, even with the crossfade on append hack.

> Saving a wav file and pltying it via Windows Media player is the solution

## Timbre
Using just sine wave sounds more like flute than violin.
- flute first two harmonics are strong, others weak
- violin harmonics weaken gradually
